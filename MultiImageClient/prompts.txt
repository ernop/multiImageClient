The area is full of guava, cheese, broccoli, kimchi, hardboiled eggs, vinegar, and durian. Each smell seems to waft through the crowd attacking people and animals who are particularly weak to it, striking them with brutal overwhelming negative sensations.

Introducing the "Rogue" card, an exciting new addition between the Queen and Jack of Diamonds in a standard playing card deck. The Rogue card features a dashing figure with a masked face, holding a small, curved dagger. The figure is adorned with a cape and a diamond-encrusted hat, symbolizing the connection to the Diamonds suit. The single-letter symbol for the Rogue card is "X", which is displayed in each corner along with the suit of Diamonds. The card's design maintains the simplicity of traditional playing cards, with the "X" and diamonds in the corners and a captivating, yet minimalist, pattern in the middle, featuring a subtle diamond-like motif. The Rogue card captures the essence of cunning and deception, adding an exciting twist to the classic deck.
